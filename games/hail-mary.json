Each tiny organism is a dedicated Astrophage hunter, evolved over millions of years for this single purpose. You watch one attack an Astrophage cell — penetrating the membrane, consuming the stored energy, then dividing to produce two hungry offspring. It's beautiful.",

Rows of culture dishes, incubators set to various temperatures, monitoring equipment — everything you need for the most important biology experiment in history.\n\nThe work is grueling. Thousands of Taumoeba cultures, each exposed to slightly different conditions, each monitored for survival. Most die. But some — a precious few — survive a little longer than the rest. You isolate those survivors, breed them, and push the next generation a little harder.\n\nRocky helps by maintaining the equipment and running calculations. He's not a biologist, but he's the best lab assistant you've ever had.",
